Okay, I've reviewed the code snippet you provided:

```javascript
function sum(){ return a + b;}
```

Here's my feedback, focusing on potential issues and improvements:

**Issues and Suggestions**

1.  **Missing Parameters:** The most significant problem is that the function `sum` doesn't accept any parameters. It attempts to use variables `a` and `b`, but these are not defined within the function's scope. This will likely lead to errors (if `a` and `b` are not defined globally) or unexpected behavior (if they *are* global variables).

    *   **Solution:**  The function *must* accept `a` and `b` as parameters.

    ```javascript
    function sum(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    }
    ```

2.  **Lack of Error Handling/Type Checking:** The function assumes that `a` and `b` will be numbers (or at least values that can be added).  If you pass in strings, you'll get string concatenation instead of numerical addition.  If you pass in other unexpected types, you might get `NaN` or errors.

    *   **Solution (Basic Type Checking):** If you need to ensure you're adding numbers, you can add a basic check.  This adds a bit of safety, though it doesn't cover all possible edge cases.

    ```javascript
    function sum(a, b) {
      if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
        return NaN; // Or throw an error: throw new Error("Arguments must be numbers");
      }
      return a + b;
    }
    ```

3.  **Lack of Documentation:**  It's good practice to document your functions, especially if they're part of a larger project or library.

    *   **Solution (JSDoc Style):**

    ```javascript
    /**
     * Adds two numbers together.
     *
     * @param {number} a The first number.
     * @param {number} b The second number.
     * @returns {number} The sum of a and b. Returns NaN if either argument is not a number.
     */
    function sum(a, b) {
      if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
        return NaN;
      }
      return a + b;
    }
    ```

4. **Arrow Function Simplification (Optional):** If you prefer a more concise syntax (and you're working in an environment that supports it), you can use an arrow function:

   ```javascript
   const sum = (a, b) => {
     if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
       return NaN;
     }
     return a + b;
   };
   ```

   Or, even more concisely, if you omit the type checking:

   ```javascript
   const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
   ```

**Revised Code (incorporating suggestions):**

Here's the version I'd recommend, balancing clarity and safety:

```javascript
/**
 * Adds two numbers together.
 *
 * @param {number} a The first number.
 * @param {number} b The second number.
 * @returns {number} The sum of a and b. Returns NaN if either argument is not a number.
 */
function sum(a, b) {
  if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
    return NaN; // Or throw an error for stricter validation
  }
  return a + b;
}
```

**Example Usage:**

```javascript
console.log(sum(5, 3));    // Output: 8
console.log(sum("5", 3));  // Output: NaN (because "5" is a string)
console.log(sum(5, null)); // Output: NaN (because null is not a number)
```

In summary, the most important fix is to add parameters to the function.  The other suggestions are about improving the robustness and readability of your code. Choose the level of complexity that's appropriate for your needs.
